This is a minimized service to fetch weather data from OpenWeatherMap or Yahoo.  
This is a clone of "OmniJaws 'Just another weather service'",  
(in some parts based of "OmniJaws 'Just another weather service'")

OpenWeatherMap API

Yahoo weather API  
https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/

Thanks to the original creators and contributors of the LockClock app and OmniJaws,

It provided a lot of insights and knowledge how to do this  
Some parts of the code like the provider access have been taken  
from it with minor modificatioons. Please check the file copyright

If you already include LockClock with your ROM you should  
consider if you really need this. The provider API is similiar  
and you dont need to different providers.
